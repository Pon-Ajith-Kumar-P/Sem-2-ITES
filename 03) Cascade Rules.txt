Cascading Rules:
Rule 1: (Precedence)
    -> If there are two or more rules applied to the same element 
        --> The latter of the two will take the precedence

Rule 2: (Specificity)
    -> If one selector is more specific than others, it takes the precedence
        --> h1 { } is more specific than of * { }
        --> p b {} is more specific than of p { }
        --> p#intro {} is more specific than of p { }

Rule 3: (Important)
    -> If we add !important after any property value
            --> It must be preferred first than other rules
